## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m that guy who loves turning **complex problems into clean, scalable code**. From crafting dashboards to deploying AI chatbots, I enjoy building cool things that *just work™*.

## ⚙️ Tech Playground

I mostly play with:

- ⚛️ React / Next.js / Tailwind CSS  
- 🐍 Python / FastAPI / Flask  
- 🐘 PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Redis  
- 🐳 Docker / GitHub Actions / CI/CD  
- 🐦 Flutter / Dart (yep, mobile too!)  
- 🎨 Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro (because UI needs love too)

...and some other tools I pick up during late-night rabbit holes. 🕳️🐇
